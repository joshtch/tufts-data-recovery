Intro to Linux Command Line Interface
=====================================

Commands to know:
    - `man`
    - `ls` (flags you should know: `-a`, `-l`)
    - `cd`
    - `pwd`
    - Control-C
    - `nano` (or optionally `vim` or `emacs`)
    - `rm` (warning: files deleted with `rm` can't be easily recovered)
    - `cp` (flags to know: `-p`, `r`)
    - `mv` (for moving files, but can also be used to rename files)
    - `less`
    - `mkdir`

Concepts to know:
    - Globbing (e.g. `ls *`)
    - Process forking with `&`
    - Flags (e.g. `ls -A`, `ls -l`)
    - Linux filesystem hierarchy (`/`, `~`, `.`, `..`)
    - Piping (e.g. `ls -l | less`)

Other important and useful commands:
    - `sudo` (use sparingly; do NOT use `sudo su`!)
    - `ps` (especially `ps aux`, `ps aux | grep 'string to search'`)
    - `kill` and `killall` (Force kill with `-9` flag, as in `kill -9 [Process ID here]`)
    - `grep`
    - `history`
    - `chown`, `chmod`, `chgrp`
    - `echo`
    - `cat`
    - `clear`
    - `du`
    - `touch`
    - Control-Z (complemented with `fg` and `jobs`)
    - Control-D
